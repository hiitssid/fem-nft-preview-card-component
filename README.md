### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Majority of the focus was using Flex property. I learned to include flex as per necessary like distributing elements across the card-component.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<main>
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-image">
      <img class="equilibrium" src="/images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="" />
      <div class="overlay">
        <img src="/images/icon-view.svg" alt="" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <h1>Equilibrium #3429</h1>
    <p>Our Equilibrium collection promotes balance and calm.</p>
    <div class="value-days">
      <div class="value">
        <img src="/images/icon-ethereum.svg" alt="" />
        <span>0.041ETH</span>
      </div>
      <div class="days">
        <img src="/images/icon-clock.svg" alt="" />
        <span>3 days left</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="creator">
      <img src="/images/image-avatar.png" alt="" />
      <p>Creation of <span>Jules Wyvern</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
```

```css
main {
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: var(--main-BG);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
.card {
  background-color: var(--card-BG);
  width: 350px;
  height: 600px;
  padding: 25px;
  border-radius: 15px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
.card-image {
  position: relative;
}
.card-image .equilibrium {
  width: 300px;
  border-radius: 15px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

The challenging part of this exercise for me was to align the overlay and view icon on the primary image that appears only over hovering the image. Though I struggule over this particular challenge and completed it, I would love to champion this case and continue sharpen my skill.
